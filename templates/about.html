    <h3>Machine Learning Models</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Linear Regression:</b> Linear Regression is a basic algorithm used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship, which can limit its flexibility but offers high interpretability and fast computation.</li>
        <li><b>Random Forest:</b> Random Forest is an ensemble model that builds multiple decision trees and averages their results to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting. It handles non-linear relationships well, but can be less interpretable and slower than simpler models.</li>
        <li><b>Gradient Boosting:</b> Gradient Boosting builds trees sequentially, where each new tree corrects errors made by previous ones. This method often delivers high accuracy, especially for structured/tabular data. However, its sensitive to hyperparameters and more prone to overfitting than Random Forest.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Chosen Model:</b> Gradient Boosting Regressor for CLV prediction due to best performance on hold-out set (lowest MAE).</p>
